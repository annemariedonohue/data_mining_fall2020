# MSBA Data Mining Project Fall 2020
This project shows a regression of fossil fuel consumption on air quality index (AQI), and demographics (deaths, income) for the past 5 years in the northeast US. There were multiple datasets condensed down to the topics of demographics, taxes, energy consumption, and AQI. The data was cleaned through python/SPSS, analyzed through SPSS, and visualized through Tableau. In conclusion, there was a direct correlation between AQI and deaths, and better air quality when replacing fossil fuel with biofuel.
