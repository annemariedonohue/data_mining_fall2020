# Data Mining Project
This project, completed in Fall 2020 of my MSBA, shows a regression of fossil fuel consumption on air quality index (AQI), and demographics (deaths, income) for the past 5 years in the northeast US. There were multiple datasets condensed down to the topics of demographics, taxes, energy consumption, and AQI. The data was cleaned through python/SPSS, analyzed through SPSS, and visualized through Tableau. The models included the nonlinear regression of AQI vs Deaths, a time series for AQI vs Demographic/BioFuel Consumption, a nonlinear regression of Deaths vs Energy Sources, a nonlinear regression of Unhealthy (Mean) Days (referring AQI) vs Energy Consumption and a model of income vs AQI. In conclusion, there was a direct correlation between AQI and deaths, and better air quality when replacing fossil fuel with biofuel. Income vs AQI had an indirect relationship, which was not predicted. There needs to be a more permanent solution of energy, with this project showing negative effects by the solution being prolonged. 
Although I helped with a lot of the analysis work, I worked mostly on the taxes dataset, which was separated by year. The python file shows the cleaning, and SPSS shows the analysis. Details about data methodology including ETL, variable section and analysis is in the document file.
